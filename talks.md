Technical talks are the most important event at PyCon India, the core
of the conference essentially. Talks are short lectures (30 min slot)
supported by a presentation. Speakers come from the Python community.

Talks are selected through a CFP (Call For Proposals)
process. Interested members of the community propose their talks. An
editorial panel designated by the organizers makes the selections.

The list of selected talks is available from
