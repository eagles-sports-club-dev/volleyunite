  * **Date**: 12th Oct, 2019

Local Python user communities and other meetup communities have been
the backbone of PyCon India, since its inception. Keeping this in
mind, this year we are providing space for communities to promote
themselves and to present their work, through community posters.

The poster session will be a 1-hour post lunch session on the first
day (12th October) of the conference. There are no other parallel
tracks scheduled during that slot. Apart from the regular technical
posters we will be having community posters, as well, as part of the
poster session.

If your community would like to take part in this please submit your
proposal at
[https://in.pycon.org/cfp/posters-2019/proposals/](https://in.pycon.org/cfp/posters-2019/proposals/)
Indicate the "Proposal Section" as "Community", while submitting your
proposal.
