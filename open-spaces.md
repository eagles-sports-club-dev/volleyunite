## What is an Open Space?

While there are the regular talk tracks, where the majority of the
participants will be present, there is always a need for breakout
discussions, impromptu talks, BoF sessions, etc.

In view of this, PyCon India has always provided an open space for this
purpose. This year will be having 4 rooms dedicated for open spaces,
each with the following capacity.

  * 30 Seats
  
  * 30 Seats
  
  * 40 Seats
  
  * 20 Seats

These rooms will be equipped with projectors and whiteboards, to
facilitate presentation and discussions.

Apart from these rooms, there will be tables and whiteboards provided
along the lobbies for people to utilize for discussions.

## How to register?

Registration for open spaces happens at the venue. But it would be good
idea to submit your proposal earlier on, so that any special
arrangements if required can be made before hand.

Here are some guidelines:

  * Allowed time open space for each slot is 15 / 30 / 45 minutes.
    
  * Reach the talk arena, 5 minutes before your talk starts.
    
  * Please specify your requirements for the talk in CFP
    description.

There is no screening process, for open spaces. Open space slots are
provided on an FCFS basis.
